<title>Sample Website #1</title>
  <body>
  <h1>My First Website</h1>
  <p>Hello World! This is my first website. Yay!
  <p>Here is another paragraph of text.
  <hr>
  <p>And here is another paragraph.
  Notice that spacing doesn't really matter.
  Everything is printed on one line on the page.
  Even though in the code, you need to use another paragraph tag.
  <p>See.
  <hr>
  <p>There's no rules against touching!
